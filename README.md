# How to use
Convert the Liber Primus text to numbers
Such that the first entry is 0, the last entry is 28. (F and EA respectively)
then type them into the program using spaces (example: 1 2 3 4), make sure that the final number is 99 for the program to continue execution. (example: 1 2 3 4 99)
Next you will see monoalphabetic guesses
for polyalphabetic, do the same thing but now you're actually altering the key.
For the 2nd Chapter (Page 3), Here is what I used:
1 28 21 15 12 0 5 99
Key divinity ->23 10 1 10 9 10 16 26 99
the output is WELKOME
